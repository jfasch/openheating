'''"rebinding" wrappers of both DBus connections and DBus objects.

DBus connections and objects tend to break on connection loss on
either side. If a client connection to the bus breaks, all is lost. If
an object's reference to a service/object breaks due to it's loss of
connection to the bus, then the local object proxy is dead.

openheating's use of objects is through instances of DBusObjectClient
(one is supposed to derive from it), and the overall
DBusConnectionProxy which is instantiated once and passed in. Recovery
is done inside, on both connections and objects.
