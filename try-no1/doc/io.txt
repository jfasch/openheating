    Hmm whats that? Contains Adafruit_CharLCD, completely
    different. Looks good nonetheless. No dependencies like
    Adafruit_CharLCD by Tony DiCola. Made for copying, no plans to
    make an installer for the package -> simply copy it out and diff
    it at times to see if update is necessary.

    Small wrapper around Rpi.GPIO and Beaglebone's IO, used by LCD
    code.
