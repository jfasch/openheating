Installation
============

Well, this sounds like OpenHeating is ready to be installed by
anybody, and just works. This is not true for the following reasons:

* Controlling my own house gives the main impetus for
  development. Barely fulfilling the requirements, and I am sure you
  don't want it at this time. Basic infrastructure is done; if you
  want to deploy a bunch of thermometers and control switches, so yes,
  ready. Otherwise not.
* Even if done, there is a high chance that your heating is different,
  and more work has to be done. If only configuration.

But anyway: while this section is mainly there for myself, it may give
a feeling of what's involved.
