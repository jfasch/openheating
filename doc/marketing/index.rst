Marketing
=========

Hm. It's not so much about marketing the project itself, but rather
about marketing myself. I run a `consulting business
<http://www.faschingbauer.co.at/de/index.html>`__ that I need to bring
forward from time to time. OpenHeating has a lot of myself in its
implementation (system level programming, architecture and
overengineering and DBus, and most of all - Python), so there is
definitely something to be had from it.
