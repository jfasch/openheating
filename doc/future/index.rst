OpenHeating will once achieve world domination through its flexible
design. It is open enough to nondestructively add such things as

* Using an "Algorithm" (for the technically inclined: this is "machine
  learning") to take the weatherforecast into account for example.
* Send out email (does anybody still use SMS?) on errors.
* Post big data into the cloud. Not that I'm a fan of it, but others
  sure are.

In the meantime though, there is an :doc:`unordered list of shorter
