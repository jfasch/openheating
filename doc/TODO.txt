* move rebind.DBusObjectClient into separate file, client.py. we
  already have object.py which contains the other side, so this would
  only be logical.

* object.DBusObject: consider to use
  DBusObjectClient.service_dbus_connection. better yet: move the
  connection to the service where it belongs!
